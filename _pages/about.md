About Me
---
Hello! I'm Dan, a senior at St. Olaf college. My main area of study and research is computer science, but I also study mathematics, data science, and English. More specifically, I have completed paid, Summer research projects in robotics and automated reasoning, but I am still looking for a professional vocation among fields like machine learning, biotechnology, and quantum computing. Also, this isn't my portfolio website! You can find that [here](https://danexistsmaybe.xyz/).

Research

Last Summer, I worked with fellow St. Olaf students on an automated reasoning project regarding SMT solvers and their instability. SMT solvers use heuristic graph searching algorithms to do formal logic, allowing software developers to prove the integrity of critical software like for aerospace or large-scale commercial servers. A well known problem with using these solvers among large development teams is their inconsistent solve times, which can change dramatically with small adjustments to the source code. We hope our work will be published to a leading conference on automated reasoning next Summer!

Additionally, in the Summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work at the University of Texas-Arlington as part of a research experience for undergraduates (REU). Over the course of that project, I learned state of the art robot navigation techniques, wrote a survey paper with a colleague, and then developed a novel path finding pipeline. 

Personal Life
---
I like cooking, biking, climbing, listening to music, sometimes I read, I recently decided I want to try learning Spanish again, and sometimes I climb a tree really high. Also I find nuts and berries and mushrooms in the woods and eat them in my house. Thrifting is fun! This Summer, I bought a motorcycle (cars are too expensive) which can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. I care a lot about politics, and I wish it were more normal for people to do so and for them to discuss it openly. Sometimes it really feels like a social taboo, and it's true that it often brings contention between people, but I just think it would be easier for the material conditions of society to improve if everybody was forced to confront the impact of their beliefs a little more often. But, I understand wanting to avoid awkward social situations! And there's always plenty of other things in the world to talk about and that are worth talking about.
